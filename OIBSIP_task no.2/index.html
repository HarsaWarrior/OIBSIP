            <b>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian Nationalist who fought for the freedom of our country againsta the british colonizers.
              Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. 
              Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.
              Neatji was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali Family in Orissa during the British Raj on 23 January 1897. He was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Services Examination.
              Returning to India in 1921, Netaji joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress.
              He followed Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress. Netaji became the Congress president in 1938.
              Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British.
              From their very young days Netaji were inspired by Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform.
              Bose believed that authoritarianism could bring liberation and reconstruction of Indian society.
              Netaji's defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians. Netaji had a very famous quote which was"Give me blood and I will give you freedom".
